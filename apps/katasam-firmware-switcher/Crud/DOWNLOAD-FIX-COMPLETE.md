# ✅ DOWNLOAD FIX COMPLETE!

## 🐛 Problem Fixed

**Issue:** "Downloaded file is 0 bytes after redirect"

All three firmware downloads were failing because:
1. GitHub redirects from `/latest/download/` to actual release URLs
2. Old code didn't properly handle redirect chains
3. File streams weren't fully closed before validation
4. No minimum size check for corrupted downloads

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### New Download Logic (main.js):

1. **✅ Recursive Redirect Handling**
   - Follows up to 5 redirects automatically
   - Handles 301, 302, 307, 308 status codes
   - Logs each redirect step

2. **✅ Proper Stream Closing**
   - Waits 100ms after file.finish event
   - Ensures file is fully written before validation
   - Prevents 0-byte file validation errors

3. **✅ File Size Validation**
   - Rejects files with 0 bytes
   - Rejects files < 10KB (firmware files are ~100KB+)
   - Logs downloaded vs written byte counts

4. **✅ Better Caching**
   - Checks cache file size > 0
   - Clears invalid cached files
   - Re-downloads if cache corrupted

5. **✅ Enhanced Logging**
   - Shows each download attempt
   - Logs HTTP status codes
   - Shows redirect URLs
   - Reports final file size

## 🎯 Test The Fix RIGHT NOW

### Step 1: Open The New Build

```bash
open "/Users/martynwatts/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Desktop/firmware-flasher-web/electron-app/dist/mac-arm64/KATASAM Firmware Switcher.app"
```

### Step 2: Try Each Firmware

1. **Device in BOOTSEL mode** (easiest to test)
2. **Select Classic 1** → Click **Apply**
3. **Watch console** for download progress
4. **Should see:**
   ```
   [DOWNLOAD] Attempt 1: https://github.com/...
   [DOWNLOAD] Response status: 302
   [DOWNLOAD] Redirecting to: https://github.com/...
   [DOWNLOAD] Response status: 200
   [DOWNLOAD] ✓ Downloaded 156789 bytes to /Users/.../Classic1.uf2
   ```
5. **Firmware should flash successfully!**

### Step 3: Test All Three

- ✅ Classic 1
- ✅ Classic 2  
- ✅ Santroller

All should download and flash without errors!

## 🎁 Bonus Improvements

1. **Smart Caching**
   - Firmware downloaded once, cached for 24 hours
   - Saves bandwidth on repeated flashes
   - Auto-clears invalid cache files

2. **Better Error Messages**
   - Shows exact HTTP status code
   - Reports redirect URLs
   - Indicates if file too small

3. **Download Resilience**
   - Tracks bytes streamed vs file size
   - Detects write failures early
   - Cleans up failed downloads
